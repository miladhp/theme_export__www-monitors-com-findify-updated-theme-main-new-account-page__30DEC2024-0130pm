It efficiently integrates images from multiple modalities, such as CR, CT, MR, cath, and echocardiogram, making it an ideal choice for radiologists seeking top-notch image quality, increased productivity, and enhanced workflow flexibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Featuring a 30-inch LCD screen, the MDCC-6230 offers the flexibility to operate as a single 6MP (3,280 x 2,048 pixels) display or split into two seamless 3MP displays (1536 x 2048 pixels each). This user-friendly design allows radiologists to organize and interpret images side by side without a center bezel or visual distractions.<\/p>\n<p>A great feature of MDCC-6230 is its power-efficient LED backlight. LED backlights consume less power, are high in brightness, and produce significantly less heat, thus greatly increasing the monitor's lifespan. In addition, MDCC-6230 is equipped with a built-in I-Guard photometer front sensor for automatic DICOM calibration and quality assurance (QA) tests, simplifying routine checks and ensuring consistently high-quality imaging.<\/p>\n<p>Equip your workspace with the Barco® Coronis Fusion MDCC-6230 and experience an enhanced workflow that aligns with the evolving needs of radiologists looking for a modern, high-quality diagnostic display for teleradiology.<\/p>","title_size_desktop":22,"title_size_mobile":21,"text_size_desktop":16,"text_size_mobile":16,"show_separator":true,"top-margin-desktop":40,"bottom-margin-desktop":40,"top-margin-mobile":40,"bottom-margin-mobile":40,"section-top-margin-desktop":25,"section-bottom-margin-desktop":80,"section-top-margin-mobile":25,"section-bottom-margin-mobile":50,"color_title":"#e1e3e4"}},"1ca2d8e9-2a09-4bc5-82c4-119335cbdba9":{"type":"custom-image-with-text","blocks":{"8aa69107-85f1-479a-83c1-34b05cd3c35b":{"type":"Image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cg2730_product_description_compression_17.webp","image_position":"right","image_width":30,"title":"Built-In Sensor to Automate Your Workflow","title_size_desktop":23,"title_size_mobile":18,"color_heading":"#4d4d4f","content":"<p>Automate your calibration with the sensor that is housed within the front bezel.
