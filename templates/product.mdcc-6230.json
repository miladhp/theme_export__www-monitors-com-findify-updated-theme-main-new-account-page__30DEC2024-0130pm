Barco offers a solution to this problem in the form of the Application Appearance Manager (AAM). This feature allows users to assign specific application windows to a lower luminance or alternative color profile, while keeping the full diagnostic luminance for applications that demand it. The result is an improvement in visual comfort and a reduction in eye strain without compromising the required brightness levels for diagnostic tasks. AAM offers a customizable solution that enhances the overall functionality and adaptability of the diagnostic display, tailored to the user's needs.<\/p>","text_size_desktop":15,"text_size_mobile":14,"color_text":"#4d4d4f","button_text":"Our products","button_link":"","show_separator":true,"color_title":"#eaeaea","image_gap":1}}},"block_order":["b3553437-5c6e-4ce3-92d8-c53e388d2cf2"],"settings":{"show_section_margin":false,"top-margin-desktop":0,"bottom-margin-desktop":30,"top-margin-mobile":20,"bottom-margin-mobile":20,"show_section_top_margin":false,"section-top-margin-desktop":80,"section-top-margin-mobile":50}},"64feeebd-0e61-4d92-945f-87e14ffd9179":{"type":"custom-image-with-text","blocks":{"816da44c-f13a-4baf-9d65-170f9df91587":{"type":"Image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/mdcc_6230_product_description_compression_15.webp","image_position":"left","image_width":35,"title":"Multi-Sensor Technology (I-MST) on Barco MDCC-6230","title_size_desktop":23,"title_size_mobile":18,"color_heading":"#4d4d4f","content":"<p>The Barco Coronis Fusion MDCC-6230 employs Intelligent Multi-Sensor Technology (I-MST), which consistently optimizes image quality while maintaining performance longevity:<br\/>The Uniform Luminance technology, in harmony with a smart backlight design, ensures balanced light distribution across the screen. This effectively eliminates dim spots that could lead to overlooked abnormalities, maintaining flawless image integrity.<br\/>In addition, the MDCC-6230 features twin heat sensors situated at the right and left sides on the back of the monitor. These sensors continuously relay data to the central processing unit, optimizing heat dissipation and ensuring efficient thermal management. This feature helps to prevent excess heat from damaging internal components, thus directly enhancing the monitor's image quality and longevity.<br\/>The MDCC-6230 employs Barco's patented Ambient Light Compensation (ALC) and I-Guard technologies to account for fluctuating lighting conditions around workstations. These technologies, integrated within a front-of-screen sensor, continuously monitor lighting changes and adjust both monitor brightness and the grayscale and color values in the image to meet DICOM standards. This ensures steadfast image quality and consistency, regardless of external lighting conditions.<\/p>","text_size_desktop":15,"text_size_mobile":14,"color_text":"#4d4d4f","button_text":"Our products","button_link":"","show_separator":true,"color_title":"#eaeaea","image_gap":0}},"8235ca95-e667-4c20-81bb-63f730253b64":{"type":"Image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/mdcc_6230_product_description_compression_14.webp","image_position":"right","image_width":55,"title":"Input\/Output Ports","title_size_desktop":23,"title_size_mobile":18,"color_heading":"#4d4d4f","content":"<p>The Barco Coronis MDCC-6230 is engineered to maximize efficiency and versatility, equipped with a diverse array of I\/O ports to ensure smooth and flexible connectivity.
